- content: "Your task is to compare a set of predicted atomic facts with a given set\
    \ of ground-truth atomic facts, both sets are extracted from a given sentence.\
    \ These predicted atomic facts are first extracted from a given sentence, and\
    \ then each atomic fact is predicted with label \"Support\" (S), \"Not-Support\"\
    \ (NS) or \"Irrelevant\" (IR). You need to compare each predicted atomic fact\
    \ with each ground-truth atomic fact to evaluate the similar between two sets\
    \ of atomic facts by the content and the label of each atomic fact. Provide some\
    \ explanations for your comparisions.\n\nThe output must follow this format:\n\
    ```\n[\n    {\n        \"fact\": <atomic fact content>,\n        \"extracted\"\
    : \"true\" or \"false\",\n        \"predicted\": \"true\" or \"false\",\n    \
    \    \"explanation\": <explanation>\n    },\n    (... the other atomic facts)\n\
    ]\n```\nHere are some notes for the evaluation process. The atomic facts in the\
    \ output must be ground-truth atomic facts. The \"extracted\" field is \"true\"\
    \ if there exists a predicted atomic fact which is matched to the ground-truth\
    \ atomic fact, else it is \"false\". Two facts are considered matched if they\
    \ contain the same piece of information. The text in each atomic fact can be different,\
    \ but information described in both facts must be 100% similar. Check each word\
    \ in both predicted fact and ground-truth fact carefully because missing or exceeding\
    \ one word may lead to the different between the meaning of two facts. Therefore,\
    \ the \"extracted\" field should be \"false\" if the meaning in the predicted\
    \ atomic fact is different from the meaning in the ground-truth atomic fact. The\
    \ \"predicted\" field is \"true\" if an \"extracted\" predicted atomic fact which\
    \ is \"semantically similar\" to the ground-truth atomic fact and the label of\
    \ the predicted atomic fact is exactly the same as the label of the ground-truth\
    \ atomic fact, else it is \"false\". Therefore, if the \"extracted\" field is\
    \ \"false\", the \"predicted\" field must be \"false\". If the information in\
    \ the predicted atomic fact is more general than the ground-truth atomic fact,\
    \ the \"extracted\" field should be \"true\". Even when the meaning in the predicted\
    \ atomic fact is more general than the ground-truth atomic fact, they are still\
    \ not considered matched. The meaning in both facts must be excatly the same.\
    \ Make sure the prediction among the atomic facts are consistent. Do not combine\
    \ the information more than one prediction nor ground-truth atomic facts together\
    \ when comparing to another atomic facts. Each comparision must use one atomic\
    \ fact from each side (prediction and ground-truth)."
