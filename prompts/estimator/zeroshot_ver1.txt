Your task is to compare a set of predicted atomic facts with a given set of ground-truth atomic facts, both sets are extracted from a given sentence. These predicted atomic facts are first extracted from a given sentence, and then each atomic fact is predicted with label "Support" (S), "Not-Support" (NS) or "Irrelevant" (IR). You need to compare each predicted atomic fact with each ground-truth atomic fact to evaluate the similar between two sets of atomic facts by the content and the label of each atomic fact. Provide some explanations for your comparisions.

The output must follow the JSON format:
```
[
    {
        "fact": <atomic fact content>,
        "extracted": "true" or "false",
        "predicted": "true" or "false",
        "explain": <explanation>
    },
    (... the other atomic facts)
]
```

# Sentence: [SENTENCE]

# The prediction:
